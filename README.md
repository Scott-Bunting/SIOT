# SIOT
Repository for Sensing and Internet-of-Things Coursework Project.

## Description
  
This is an online repository for all files and data for the SIOT coursework.  
The project uses the bme680 Sensor and the Open Weather Map API, to compare indoor and outdoor temperature data.  
The data is then used to provide insights on energy consumption and provide alerts for thermal events in the home.
